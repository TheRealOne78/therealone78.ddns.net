                <b>Trolled!</b><br>
                you've been trolled<br>
                Yes, you've probably been told<br>
                Don't reply to this guy<br>
                He's just trying to get a rise<br>
                Out of you, yes, it's true<br>
                You respond and that's his cue<br>
                To start trouble on the double<br>
                While he strokes his manly stubble<br>
                <br>
                You've been trolled, you've been trolled<br>
                You should probably just fold<br>
                When the only winning move is not to play<br>
                And yet you keep on trying, mindlessly replying<br>
                You've been trolled, you've been trolled, have a nice day<br>

              The <span class="selected">HTTP 418 I'm a teapot</span> client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is, permanently, a teapot. A combined coffee/tea pot that is temporarily out of coffee should instead return 503. This error is a reference to Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol defined in April Fools' jokes in 1998 and 2014.<br>
              Some websites use this response for requests they do not wish to handle, such as automated queries.<br>
