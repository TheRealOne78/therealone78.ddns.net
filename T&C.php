          By downloading this game you will become a tester. You can't share this link, or the game before the license will be complete. Unfortunely, the game is still proprietary software, but will soon become FLOSS with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt" target="_blank">GNU GPL v3 license</a>.<br>
          You can't share this DNS(also related with website link) to anyone, not even your friends, parents or your boss. However, even as tester, you are not obliged to report problems (also known in programming as bugs, glitches, code problems). You can report problems at <a href ="mailto:bajcsielias78@gmail.com">bajcsielias78@gmail.com</a>.<br>
