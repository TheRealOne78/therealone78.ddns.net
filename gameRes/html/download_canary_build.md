Did you read the [**Terms and Conditions**](/T&C.html)?

# <span style="color: red;">Hold up for just a minute!</span>

This is a canary dev build page, which includes only canary builds of my game.

## What does that mean?
It means that right here, in this very moment you are in a dangerous place where there are only untested binary releases of my game, that are **very unstable** and **only for experimental use**.

Use this only if you are a developer/tester and you know what you are doing.

If you say that "Oh hey, canary is more stable than the official tested realeases people, I know it because I am a dev and I know what I am doing", it means that you don't know what you are doing.

There isn't and won't be nice design for this page since there will be a lot of releases here.
