	TheRealOne. IRL I am a 17 years old boy called Bajcsi Elias-Robert. I like dev, games, electronics, cooking and my bike.
	I live in Romania(cuz why not lol) in a nice ass city called Bra»ôov.
	<h1>/> Why I made this website</h1>
	Because I can. My internet, my DNS, my IP, my HTML code, my server, my money, my everything lol. Noone can tell me what to do with my site.
	<br/><br/>
	Here another reason that I made this webpage (probably interesting IDK):
	It's this nice ass discord dev server called <b>Lazy Developers</b> where the <span style='color: #FF4500'>@moderators</span> made karate belts, tho, with dev instead of karate.
	I want the purple belt! To gain that belt, I need to host my own website in my own server a html page with valid HSTS headers and a valid SSL/TLS certificate.<br/><br/>
	Here the link of the server, don't click it lol: <a href = "https://discord.gg/Ajr5P3V" target= "_blank">https://discord.gg/Ajr5P3V</a>
	<br><br/>
	Aaaaaand, another reason that might or might not interest you, I am just saying:<br/>
	I met the owner of a minecraft server, a very nice guy. He teached me how to host a FTP server and a HTTP server. He wasn't nervous at all, he had a lot of patience teaching me and I respect him.
	Here his discord server for respect: <a href="https://discord.gg/nRs7nSHZ">https://discord.gg/nRs7nSHZ</a>
	<h1>/> Do I have TikTok</h1>
	Do: Fatal Error: Unknown argument "TikTok". Please shut down your computer with a hammer or/and other tools immediately!<br/>
	Check this video for instructions: <a href = "https://youtu.be/HtTUsOKjWyQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/HtTUsOKjWyQ</a>. Please ignore the title.
