title: Links and stuff :p
description: A HTML page containing a list of main and unlisted URLs of this domain
keywords: uris, urls, links, anchors
---

As the name of the title implies, this is a webpage indexing all the main URLs and some hidden URLs that are not listed to the main or other pages in this domain. Other third-party domains that have these links to not count to be as "listed".

The reason there are unlisted URL's is because I just don't want to bloat my other pages or there are some copyrighted content(more detailed in the next parragraph), or it's just cringe(and also don't wanna bloat my pages with cringe) :/

Note that there are still hidden HTML pages, because of copyright issues I can't put these URLs linking to the copyrighted content. The pages may be listed someday if the authors of the copyrighted content aprove.
