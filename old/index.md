# user@therealone78.ddns.net:~$ Why did you make this website
Because it is:
- My right
- My internet subscription
- My domain
- My IP address
- My MD/HTML/CSS/JS Jekyll code
- My server (I mean... it's just an old 4-core laptop)
- My money
- My everything!

No one can tell me what to do with my site.

But here is another reason as to why I've made this website (probably interesting <abbr title="I Don't Know">IDK</abbr>):

I met the owner of a minecraft server, a very nice guy, <span class="red-role">@Salzamar</span>. He taught me on how to host a FTP and HTTP server. He wasn't pissed at all (at least I hope), he had a lot of patience teaching me and I really respect him for that.

Here is his 1.6.2 minecraft server, <a href="http://advguild.myftp.org" target="_blank" class="thirdParty">advguild.myftp.org</a>.
